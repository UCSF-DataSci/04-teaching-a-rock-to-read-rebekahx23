Wilson's work routine: Wilson reports to the League office every morning from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., where he must remain inside the room the entire time and copy articles from the Encyclopaedia Britannica by hand. He is not allowed to leave for any reason and is paid £4 per week for this work.
What happened: After eight weeks of consistent work and payment, Wilson arrived one morning to find the office locked and a notice on the door stating that the Red-Headed League had been dissolved.
